Collaborative Filtering (User-based and Item-based)
Content-based Filtering
Hybrid Recommendation System
SVD-based Matrix Factorization
Neural Network Recommendations
Deep Learning Models for complex patterns
- Genre and Metadata Analysis

- Caching and Batch Processing
- IP-based location detection for regional content
- Content-based filtering using genre, language, and metadata analysis
- ML service integration for deep learning recommendations
- Regional preference learning (local vs international content)
- Language preference tracking and suggestions
- Fallback strategies for new users and service failures


ML Algorithms to Implement:
python# Required recommendation algorithms:
1. User-Based Collaborative Filtering
2. Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
3. Content-Based Filtering (genre, language, metadata)
4. Hybrid Recommendation System
5. SVD Matrix Factorization
6. Neural Collaborative Filtering
7. Deep Learning Content Analysis
8. Regional Preference Learning
9. Language Preference Tracking
10. Mood-based Recommendations
ML Service Endpoints:
