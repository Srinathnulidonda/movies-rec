main prioritie is telugu and the language_priorities=['telugu', 'english', 'hindi', 'malayalam', 'kannada', 'tamil', 'other']

sort the order accoriding to the release date make 
make sure that the upcoming 3 months releasing content should be shown when the user is seeing that date to 3 months

edit the endpoint so that it can perform all the several things through only single endpoint 
like 1 month data, 2 months, 3 months, genre, language, type and other all things
